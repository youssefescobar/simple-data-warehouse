A simple ELT Data pipeline that populates a datewarehouse.

Phase 1: Data source

Since i want it to be as realistic as possible ill design a OLTP db on postgres and then extract from it to simulate a working production db.

1. Inits: i have to get a docker container running postgres up to start designing and seeding.
so ill start with simple docker compose file and only make 1 service which is the docker container.

its done, to connect 
docker exec -it production_db psql -U admin -d xyz_store

1.2 design prod db: 
https://dbdiagram.io/
 
as realistic as possible, makes u write near DMBL to create tables and visualize them. so i can eidt and paste into psql on the spot.

the main idea of the "prod db" is i want it to be realistic so ill follow an OLTP design and make it 3nf

desgin done. now running the schema.sql file using 
docker exec -i production_db psql -U admin -d xyz_store < schema.sql

maked a seeder file and seeded the db
